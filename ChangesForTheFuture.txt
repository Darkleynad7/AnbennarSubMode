1. Mission tree for Kobildzhan focused on consolidating around the dragon coast with a part of the tree focusing
on unlocking all the Dragon Cults (with diplomacy/conquering and owning money and prestige). After all the cults are unlocked u
can make a decision to unlock a final cult (or a new religion). (maybe a new empire formable for the new religion)

2. Flavor for the Aelantir Kobold Expedition (Spawns out of Green Scale) with implemeting Drozma Tur (their new religion) and maybe 
some dragon related artifacts and new Kobold culture for them + a fomable.

3. Halles formable for the Golden Kobolds with missions and a similar mission tree to Kobildzhan to collect all the cults. (maybe 
some interactions with the command as the other monster nation in that area). Since the golden Kobolds start with the Rigtheous 
Path religion, they should get a provinve with the dragon kult religion and an event to convert to their old ways)
